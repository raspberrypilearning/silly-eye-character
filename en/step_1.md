## Introduction

In this project, you will design and create a silly eye character. The character's large, silly eyes will follow the mouse pointer to bring your character to life.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Design**</span> means deciding on the way that a project looks and making decisions about what it does. 
</p>

You will:
+ Make a project with **user interaction**
+ Personalise a project with colour and graphic effects
+ Learn about design in digital making 

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**User**</span> means the person using the project (not just making it), and <span style="color: #0faeb0">**user interaction**</span> is how the project reacts to the user doing things such as moving the mouse and clicking on the screen.
